# Blot GCODE Firmware

A minimal, GRBL-protocol-compatible G-code firmware for the Blot pen plotter
(Seeed XIAO RP2040 + A4988 drivers + servo pen-lift).

Lives separately from the legacy firmware at
`hardware/motor-control-board/firmware/`. This folder is self-contained.

## Goals, in priority order

1. **Accuracy.** It's a pen plotter. Never lose a step. Corners hit their
   programmed position. Arcs are round.
2. **GRBL-protocol compatibility.** Standard senders (Universal G-code Sender,
   bCNC, OctoPrint with a GRBL plugin) stream to it without special support.
3. **Low overhead.** Buffered streaming, not request/response. Arc interpolation
   on-device. 115200 baud.
4. **Simple.** Readable in an afternoon. ~1000 lines total.

## Hardware assumptions

Matches the legacy firmware's wiring so the existing boards work unchanged:

| Signal          | Pin  |
|-----------------|------|
| Motor 1 STEP    | D10  |
| Motor 1 DIR     | D9   |
| Motor 2 STEP    | D8   |
| Motor 2 DIR     | D7   |
| Driver ENABLE   | D1   |
| Pen servo (PWM) | D6   |

CoreXY mixing: `motor1 = x + y`, `motor2 = y − x`. A4988 16× microstepping
with 20-tooth GT2 pulleys on 2 mm-pitch belt → **80 microsteps/mm**.

## Supported G-code

Modal groups are GRBL-compatible. Only what a pen plotter actually needs.

### Motion

| Code | Meaning                                                |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| G0   | Rapid (non-drawing) move at max feedrate              |
| G1   | Linear feed move at current feedrate                  |
| G2   | Clockwise arc (I/J center offset, or R radius)        |
| G3   | Counter-clockwise arc                                 |
| G4   | Dwell (P milliseconds, or S seconds)                  |

### Units & coordinates

| Code | Meaning                                                |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| G20  | Inches                                                 |
| G21  | Millimeters (default)                                  |
| G90  | Absolute positioning (default)                         |
| G91  | Relative positioning                                   |
| G92  | Set work coordinate offset                            |
| G28  | Soft home (return to origin — see caveat below)       |

### Pen / "spindle"

Pen-up/pen-down is mapped onto GRBL's spindle commands so stock senders work.

| Code          | Meaning                                                    |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| M3 S<value>   | Pen down at servo PWM microseconds (default 1700 µs)      |
| M5            | Pen up (default 1000 µs)                                  |

Clarification: `S` is interpreted directly as a PWM pulse width in
microseconds, range 500–2500. This sidesteps GRBL's 0–1000 RPM scaling and
matches how servo libraries are configured everywhere.

### System

| Code | Meaning                                                |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| M17  | Enable stepper drivers                                 |
| M18  | Disable stepper drivers                                |
| M0   | Program pause (wait for `~`)                           |
| M2   | Program end                                            |

### Settings

`$$` prints the settings list. `$N=value` sets a setting. Persisted to flash.

| $N   | Name                  | Default     | Units                  |
|------|-----------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| $100 | steps_per_mm (motor)  | 80.000      | steps / mm             |
| $110 | max_feedrate          | 1500        | mm / min               |
| $111 | max_rapid_rate        | 1500        | mm / min               |
| $120 | max_acceleration      | 200         | mm / s²                |
| $130 | max_travel_x          | 200         | mm                     |
| $131 | max_travel_y          | 200         | mm                     |
| $140 | junction_deviation    | 0.005       | mm                     |
| $141 | arc_tolerance         | 0.002       | mm                     |
| $150 | servo_pen_up_us       | 1000        | µs                     |
| $151 | servo_pen_down_us     | 1700        | µs                     |
| $152 | servo_move_delay_ms   | 150         | ms                     |

These defaults are deliberately conservative — tuned for accuracy on a freshly
assembled machine, not maximum speed.

### Realtime commands (single bytes, not line-buffered)

| Byte   | Name        | Action                                               |
|--------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `?`    | Status      | Report `<State|MPos:x,y|FS:feed,0>` immediately     |
| `!`    | Feed hold   | Decelerate to zero, hold the buffer                 |
| `~`    | Cycle start | Resume after hold / release M0 pause                |
| `0x18` | Soft reset  | Flush buffer, clear alarms, return to idle          |

### Soft home caveat

There are no limit switches. `G28` moves to the last-stored origin (the point
where `G92 X0 Y0` was called, or power-on position). It does not find (0, 0)
mechanically. Users are expected to position the carriage manually before
starting a job, same as the legacy firmware.

## Streaming protocol

Character-counting flow control, GRBL-standard:

- Each received line that parses OK → firmware replies `ok\r\n` when the line
  is consumed from the serial RX buffer (not when the move completes).
- Parse errors → `error:<n>\r\n` where n is a GRBL error code.
- The host keeps the RX buffer (128 bytes) mostly-full by tracking sent-but-
  unacked characters.

This is what unlocks buffered streaming: the host pushes ~10–50 moves deep
without waiting for motion, and the motion planner overlaps them.

### CoreXY-aware acceleration (this is the important part)

Blot is CoreXY-style: `motor1 = x + y`, `motor2 = y − x`. That means the same
motor acceleration does *not* produce the same Cartesian tip acceleration in
every direction. Specifically, for a Cartesian move along direction
`(dx, dy) / L`:

- `|A_per_tip| = |dx + dy| / L`  → 1 for axis-aligned, **√2 at 45°**, 0 for -45°
- `|B_per_tip| = |dy − dx| / L`  → 1 for axis-aligned, 0 at 45°, **√2 at -45°**

So if we naively clamp acceleration in motor space, the tip would have:

- Full programmed accel on pure X/Y moves (both motors at the same ratio)
- **1/√2 accel on ±45° diagonals** (because one motor has to move √2× as fast)
- A different accel again at every other angle

Discontinuous Cartesian accel at block boundaries = stepper cogging, belt
ringing, and visible corner artefacts. Not OK on a pen plotter.

**What this firmware does instead:**

1. Feedrates, junction deviation, and the trapezoidal profile are all planned
   in **Cartesian tip-space** (units: mm, mm/s, mm/s²). That's what the user
   cares about and what determines how the drawing *looks*.
2. Per block, we compute `max_motor_per_tip = max(|A_per_tip|, |B_per_tip|)`
   — this is how many motor-space mm the faster motor travels per Cartesian
   mm of tool path.
3. The block's effective Cartesian acceleration is clamped to
   `min(user_accel, motor_max_accel / max_motor_per_tip)`. On axis-aligned
   moves this equals `user_accel`; on 45° diagonals it drops by 1/√2.
4. Likewise for speed: `max_tip_feedrate = motor_max_rate / max_motor_per_tip`.
5. The stepper ISR generates "step events" at the rate the Cartesian profile
   asks for; Bresenham then distributes each event to motor1, motor2, both, or
   neither, based on the integer step deltas. Per-event the motors see
   exactly the CoreXY mix they should.

The net effect: along any straight line the tip accelerates at a single
constant rate (smooth), which may be lower than the user-requested accel to
respect physical motor limits. Corners are handled by the junction-deviation
model in Cartesian, so the cornering speed is determined by the *path*
geometry, not the motor mix.

The planner does a two-pass algorithm on every enqueue: a reverse pass (from
newest to oldest) clamps each block's entry speed against the next block's
entry speed plus acceleration; a forward pass clamps again going the other
way. This is straight from GRBL's planner. Junction deviation models cornering
as a centripetal-acceleration constraint, which is much better than "decel to
zero at every corner" but cheaper than S-curves.

### Max-speed note

Because `max_motor_per_tip` is 1 on axes and √2 on diagonals (the inverse of
what a Cartesian printer does), pure X/Y moves are the *fastest* directions
on Blot; ±45° diagonals are the slowest. This is the opposite of most users'
intuition — keep it in mind when setting `$110 max_feedrate`.

## Building

Arduino IDE with the `arduino-pico` core (earlephilhower/arduino-pico) and
the built-in `Servo` library. Select board: **Seeed XIAO RP2040**.

All files in this directory compile as one sketch. Open `firmware.ino`.

## Testing on bench before plotting

Before plugging a pen in:

1. Flash firmware, open a serial terminal at 115200.
2. Send `?` — should see `<Idle|MPos:0.000,0.000|FS:0,0>`.
3. Send `M17` then `G21 G90 G1 X10 Y0 F600` — single motor should turn.
4. Send `G1 X0 Y0` — should return.
5. Send `G2 X20 Y0 I10 J0 F600` — semicircle; verify shape by hand-tracing.
6. Send `M3 S1700` / `M5` — servo should click between positions.
7. Pipe the test file in `test_gcode/square.gcode` at a 10× scale-down to
   validate corner accuracy without eating paper.

Until you've done steps 1–6, don't run real art through it.

## What this firmware deliberately does NOT do

- No limit switch handling (there aren't any)
- No probing (`G38`)
- No tool change
- No spindle PWM (M3 is repurposed for servo)
- No coolant
- No CoreXY auto-detection — it's hardcoded, because this firmware is only for Blot
- No `$H` hard homing (there's nothing to home against)
- No EEPROM compatibility with GRBL's settings layout — we use our own
  (settings IDs are GRBL-ish but values and semantics differ)

If you need any of those, use stock GRBL-HAL on a board with the right I/O
instead.

## Known limitations

These are deliberate V1 compromises, not bugs:

- **Planner race with an in-flight block.** `planner_recalculate()` can
  modify the `entry_speed`/trapezoid fields of the block the stepper ISR is
  currently stepping. On a pen plotter the window is vanishingly small
  (blocks are ms, recalculate is µs), but worth flagging. A `volatile bool
  busy` guard is the fix if we ever see artefacts.
- **Feed hold stops at block boundaries, not mid-motion across blocks.** If
  a block completes while in feed hold, we park in `ST_HELD` rather than
  continuing decel across the next block. Simpler and correct for pen
  plotting, but less elegant than GRBL's multi-block decel chain.
- **Motor-step rounding is bounded at ±0.5 step, not per-segment.** The
  planner rounds each block's motor delta relative to the *absolute* target
  position, not the per-segment Cartesian delta. So endpoint error is
  ±0.00625 mm (half a microstep) regardless of how many arc segments were
  emitted — no √N drift accumulation.
- **Settings are RAM-only.** Lost on power cycle. Flash persistence is a
  one-file addition but not in V1.
- **`G92` offsets persist and accumulate** without a `G92.1` to clear them.
  Set a clean origin with `G92 X0 Y0` after homing manually.
- **Soft reset (`0x18`) preserves `motor_pos_steps`**, because on real
  hardware the motors are physically wherever they are. Tests use a
  separate `stepper_test_zero_position()` under `FIRMWARE_TEST`.
