# Tuning Blot — speed and acceleration

After you flash the firmware, every Blot ships with conservative limits in `$110`/`$112`/`$120`/`$122`. They're safe enough that a freshly-assembled machine won't skip steps — but slow enough that a full-canvas stipple takes _forever_. Tuning pushes those caps up to whatever your specific belts, motors, and driver current can actually handle, then backs off to a safety margin. The payoff: the same drawing plots in a fraction of the time.

The guided script [`tools/tune.py`](tools/tune.py) walks you through it. This doc explains **why** it does what it does and how to read its output. Run the script when following along.

## Why there are four numbers to tune, not two

Cartesian printers have one speed cap and one accel cap per axis, and that's it. Blot is CoreXY, so the same Cartesian move puts different loads on the motors depending on direction:

```
motor1 =  x + y
motor2 = -x + y
```

That means:

| Tip direction | What the motors actually do                                     | Which motor is the bottleneck                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pure X or Y   | **Both** motors turn at the same rate                           | Neither — it's a tie                                            |
| ±45° diagonal | **One** motor turns at `√2×` tip speed;<br>the other sits still | The spinning motor — it sees √2 more work per mm of tip         |
| Anything else | Mix of the two                                                  | Whichever is closer to diagonal                                 |

So the same "go 100 mm/s" command asks the motors to do different things in different directions. If you tune the limit by pushing pure-X until something skips, you get a number that's too high for diagonals — the spinning motor on a diagonal hits its step-rate ceiling before the Cartesian cap does.

**The solution: separate caps for each space.** The firmware tracks two numbers per quantity:

| Setting | Space     | Tuned by      | Meaning                                      |
| ------- | --------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `$110`  | Cartesian | Axis test     | Max tip feedrate (mm/min)                    |
| `$112`  | Motor     | Diagonal test | Max rate of an individual motor (mm/min)     |
| `$120`  | Cartesian | Axis test     | Max tip acceleration (mm/s²)                 |
| `$122`  | Motor     | Diagonal test | Max individual-motor acceleration (mm/s²)    |

Per block, the planner computes the block's motor load (1 on axis-aligned, √2 on diagonals, somewhere between otherwise) and clamps to `min($110, $112 / load)` for speed and `min($120, $122 / load)` for acceleration. **This is how CoreXY stops shooting itself in the foot on diagonals** — axis moves run at full `$110`/`$120`, diagonals automatically slow to the lower of the two caps.

The net: pure-X and pure-Y are the _fastest_ directions on Blot; ±45° diagonals are the slowest. Exact opposite of a Cartesian printer.

## Why you have to tune, not just guess

Steppers don't give a soft warning before they skip — one moment the motor is following the commanded motion, the next it's slipping because torque dropped out from under it. You can't get to the edge of safe motion without feeling for the cliff, so the tune process is:

1. Set a candidate cap.
2. Run a known pattern that should return to (0, 0).
3. Compare the pen's end position against a starting mark.
4. If the pen is off the mark, the motors skipped — back off.
5. If not, push the cap higher and try again.
6. When you find the cliff, save **80%** of the last-passing value so jitter, ink drag, and temperature don't creep you back over the edge.

The firmware's internal position counter (`MPos:`) tracks commanded pulses, not real motor rotation — so by itself it won't tell you when the motor skipped. That's why this test is physical: the pen drifts on paper, you see it.

## Using `tools/tune.py`

The script does all of the above automatically, including the CoreXY-aware push/pull of cross-constraints. You answer _y_/_n_ between iterations based on whether the pen came back home.

### Setup

1. Put a pen in the holder; tape down a sheet of paper.
2. **Hand-move** the carriage so there's ~120 mm of free travel in both `+X` and `+Y`. (The script uses 100 mm for axis tests and ~71 mm for the diagonals.)
3. Close anything else that owns the USB port (UGS, the Blot UI, etc).
4. Install `pyserial` if you don't have it:
   ```bash
   pip3 install pyserial
   ```

### Run it

```bash
python3 rmrrf/firmware/tools/tune.py
python3 rmrrf/firmware/tools/tune.py --port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
python3 rmrrf/firmware/tools/tune.py --tests CA      # just axis accel + axis speed
python3 rmrrf/firmware/tools/tune.py --fine          # small steps from current values
```

### What happens

The script runs **tests in the order C → D → A → B**, which is _accel first, speed second_. That's deliberate: a speed test with low accel would hit a triangle velocity profile (`v_peak = √(a·L)`) long before it hit the commanded feedrate, and every "y, faster" answer after that would be a false positive — you'd be measuring the accel cap, not the speed cap.

| Test | Setting | What it measures                               |
| ---- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| C    | `$120`  | Axis-aligned acceleration (pure X, 20 mm hops) |
| D    | `$122`  | Diagonal acceleration (45°, 14 mm hops)        |
| A    | `$110`  | Axis-aligned top speed (pure X, 100 mm strokes)|
| B    | `$112`  | Diagonal top speed (45°, 50 mm strokes)        |

For each test:

1. The script pushes every _other_ cap to a huge number so only the value under test can be the bottleneck. Without this, a low `$112` would silently cap `$110` during Test A and your "still works" answers wouldn't mean anything.
2. It sends the pattern, waits for Idle, reads `MPos:`.
3. You answer `y` (pen came home, no stalls) / `n` (pen drifted or stalls heard) / `r` (retry same value) / `q` (stop this test).
4. On `y` it multiplies the value by the growth factor (×1.5 coarse, ×1.1 fine) and repeats.
5. On `n` it backs off to 80% (coarse) or 90% (fine) of the last passing value and writes that to flash via `$N=...`.

When all four tests are done the script writes each tuned number back to the firmware and restores anything it pushed out of the way but didn't actually tune. Settings persist across power cycles — no extra save step.

### What to look and listen for

The clearest failure modes, in order of subtlety:

- **Pen drifts a visible amount** from the starting dot — classic step loss, answer `n`.
- **Audible grindy/clacky noise** during the move — the motor is right at the edge of stalling even if `MPos:` looks right. Answer `n`.
- **Pen stops short or overshoots** — the planner is hitting an internal limit the test didn't expect. Redo that test with a lower start value.

### When to use `--fine`

Do a full coarse run first (leave the defaults). That'll get you in the ballpark but the 1.5× growth means the last-passing value is anywhere from 1.0× to 1.5× the _actual_ cliff. The tuned value (80% of that) is safe but possibly more conservative than it needs to be.

Follow up with `--fine` — it starts at 0.95× the stored value and steps 1.1× per iteration, backing off to 90% when you fail. You'll land within ~5% of the real cliff.

### Caps you don't tune

The script skips `$111` (rapid feedrate). It writes `$111 = min($112, max($110, stored $111))` after the rest finishes — that gives you travel moves that are at least as fast as feed moves but never ask the motor for more than its tuned motor-rate cap.

Everything else (`$100` steps/mm, `$151` servo pen-down) is physical calibration, not speed tuning — set those with a ruler and a test stroke, not with tune.py.

## Reasonable numbers to aim for

Your mileage will differ, but to know if your results look sane:

| Setting | Conservative | Aggressive |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| `$110`  | 3000         | 9000       |
| `$112`  | 3000         | 12000      |
| `$120`  | 500          | 2000       |
| `$122`  | 500          | 2500       |

`$112`/`$122` are higher than `$110`/`$120` because the Cartesian cap is the _tip_ cap — the motor cap only binds when the move's direction needs one motor to outrun the other (on diagonals, that's √2×).

## If you want to do it by hand

The tests `tune.py` automates are just short G-code sequences. If you prefer driving it yourself from UGS / bCNC / any terminal, the patterns are in `tools/tune.py` — look at `pattern_a` through `pattern_d`. Start each test from a taped-down pen mark, send the pattern, then `?` and read back `MPos`. Back off to 80% when the pen misses its origin.
