# Blot Firmware — Supported Commands

Quick reference for what this firmware accepts. Anything not listed here returns `error:20` (unsupported command).

The firmware advertises itself as `Grbl 1.1f` on connect so standard GRBL senders (UGS, bCNC, OctoPrint + GRBL plugin) recognize it. `$I` returns `[VER:1.1f.Blot:]`.

## Motion (G-codes)

| Code | Words             | Meaning                                              |
|------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `G0` | `X Y`             | Rapid move at `$111 max_rapid` (pen-up traversal)    |
| `G1` | `X Y F`           | Linear feed move at programmed feedrate              |
| `G2` | `X Y I J` or `X Y R` | Clockwise arc. `I/J` = center offset from current; `R` = radius |
| `G3` | `X Y I J` or `X Y R` | Counter-clockwise arc                             |
| `G4` | `P<ms>` or `S<sec>` | Dwell — blocks motion for the specified time       |

### Motion notes

- Missing `X` or `Y` holds the previous value on that axis.
- `R`-form arcs: positive `R` takes the short way, negative `R` takes the long way.
- Zero-length moves are silently dropped.
- Arc endpoints are exact within ±1 microstep (0.0125 mm) thanks to absolute-target step rounding — drift does not accumulate with segment count.

## Coordinates & units (modal)

Origin `(0, 0)` is the bottom-left corner of the work area. `+X` is right, `+Y` is up. Homing is manual — you position the carriage at your desired origin and send `G92 X0 Y0`.

| Code  | Meaning                                                         |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `G20` | Coordinates in inches (multiplied by 25.4 internally)           |
| `G21` | Coordinates in millimeters *(default)*                          |
| `G90` | Absolute positioning *(default)*                                |
| `G91` | Relative positioning                                            |
| `G92` | `X Y` — set current position as new work origin (offset)        |
| `G28` | Rapid to stored origin (the last `G92` point, or 0,0 at boot)   |

## Pen / servo (repurposed spindle commands)

| Code       | Meaning                                                         |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `M3 S<us>` | Pen down. `S` is the servo pulse width in microseconds (default 1700 µs). Sync-queued: fires in order with motion |
| `M5`       | Pen up (returns to `$150` pulse width, default 1000 µs)         |

### Pen notes

- There's a ~150 ms dwell after each servo command so the mechanical lift/drop completes before motion resumes.
- `M3` without `S` uses the last-commanded / persisted down value.
- `M3 S<us>` persists its pulse width to flash (as `$151`), so your calibrated down position survives power cycles.

## Machine control (M-codes)

| Code           | Meaning                                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `M17`          | Enable stepper drivers (motors hold position)                |
| `M18` / `M84`  | Disable stepper drivers (motors free-wheel)                  |
| `M0` / `M1`    | Program pause — triggers feed hold, release with `~`         |
| `M2` / `M30`   | Program end — no-op (no spindle/coolant to turn off)         |

---

## Settings (`$` commands)

| Command         | Returns / does                                                |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$`  or `$$`    | Dump all settings                                             |
| `$I`            | Build info — `[VER:1.1f.Blot:]` and `[OPT:V,16,128]`          |
| `$G`            | Parser state — current modal block                            |
| `$N=<value>`    | Set setting `N` (see table below)                             |
| `$RST=*`        | Reset all settings to compile-time defaults (also `$RST=$`, `$RST=#`) |
| `$X`            | Clear alarm — no-op `ok` (we have no alarm state)             |
| `$H`            | *Not supported* (no limit switches on Blot)                   |
| `$J=<motion>`   | Jog — one-shot move with temporary modal scope (see below)    |

### Tunable settings

| `$N` | Name                  | Default   | Units       |
|------|-----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `$100` | `steps_per_mm`        | `80.000`  | steps/mm    |
| `$110` | `max_feedrate`        | `1500`    | mm/min (Cartesian tip cap) |
| `$111` | `max_rapid_rate`      | `1500`    | mm/min (G0 rapid cap) |
| `$112` | `motor_max_rate`      | `1500`    | mm/min (motor-space physical cap) |
| `$120` | `max_acceleration`    | `200`     | mm/s² (Cartesian tip) |
| `$122` | `motor_max_accel`     | `500`     | mm/s² (motor-space physical cap) |
| `$130` | `max_travel_x`        | `125`     | mm (documentation only; not soft-limit-enforced yet) |
| `$131` | `max_travel_y`        | `125`     | mm |
| `$140` | `junction_deviation`  | `0.05`    | mm — corner tolerance; smaller ⇒ tighter corners, slower cornering |
| `$141` | `arc_tolerance`       | `0.002`   | mm — max chord deviation from true arc |
| `$150` | `servo_pen_up_us`     | `1000`    | µs |
| `$151` | `servo_pen_down_us`   | `1700`    | µs |

**Two tiers for speed and accel.** `$110`/`$120` cap the Cartesian tool-path
values; `$112`/`$122` cap motor-space values. The planner takes the minimum
of both per move (load-weighted on diagonals). Tune `$112`/`$122` to your
physical machine limits; use `$110`/`$120` as the "what I actually want to
draw at" cap. See [TUNING.md](TUNING.md) for the procedure.

### Persistence

Settings are **persisted to flash** (EEPROM emulation). After a `$N=` command,
the change is held in RAM and written to flash **~500 ms later, once the
stepper is idle** — so rapid-fire `$N=` bursts (from tuning scripts, say)
are coalesced into a single flash write rather than one per command. This
stops flash-erase stalls from locking up the main loop and causing serial
sync issues with senders like UGS.

### `$J=` jog

One-shot move used by senders for arrow-key / step jogging. The text after `=` is parsed as a motion line; any `G90/G91/G20/G21` inside the jog applies *only* to that jog and does not leak into subsequent lines.

- `$J=G91X1F300` — jog +1 mm in X at 300 mm/min
- `$J=G91X-1Y1F500` — diagonal jog
- `$J=G90X50Y50F1000` — absolute jog to (50, 50)

### `$RST=*` — reset to defaults

Wipes all persisted settings and restores compile-time defaults. Useful when
a tuning run has left the stored values in a weird state. The reset
propagates through the same debounced save path, so the flash blob updates
once the stepper is idle.

```
$RST=*     ; or $RST=$ or $RST=#
```

## Realtime bytes (single byte, not line-buffered)

These bytes are intercepted *before* the line parser — they work at any time, even mid-motion.

| Byte    | Name         | Action                                           |
|---------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `?`     | Status       | Emit `<State|MPos:x,y,0.000|FS:feed,0>` immediately (Z always 0 for UGS compat) |
| `!`     | Feed hold    | Decelerate to zero, hold the planner buffer      |
| `~`     | Cycle start  | Resume after hold / release a `M0`/`M1` pause    |
| `0x18`  | Soft reset   | Flush planner, clear line buffer, re-emit welcome |
| `0x85`  | Jog cancel   | Abort any in-flight jog and flush the planner    |

### Status states

| State  | Meaning                                              |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Idle` | Nothing running, planner empty                       |
| `Run`  | Motion in progress                                   |
| `Hold` | Feed hold active (`!` or `M0`/`M1`)                  |

`FS:<feedrate_mm_min>,0` — feedrate is the current Cartesian tip speed. The `0` is the spindle field, always zero since we don't have one.

## Word parameters (after a letter)

| Word   | Meaning                                                       |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `X Y`  | Axis coordinates                                              |
| `F`    | Feedrate (mm/min, or in/min when in `G20`). Modal.            |
| `I J`  | Arc center offset (from current position). `G2`/`G3` only.    |
| `R`    | Arc radius (alternative to `I`/`J`). `G2`/`G3` only.          |
| `P`    | Dwell milliseconds (`G4`)                                     |
| `S`    | Seconds for `G4` dwell, *or* servo PWM microseconds for `M3`  |

Number format: decimal only. Optional `-`/`+` sign, optional fraction. No scientific notation (`1e3`), no hex (`0x10`).

| `33` | Invalid arc radius (R too small, or I/J resolve to zero)      |
| `60` | Line overflow (exceeded 95-char line buffer)                  |

## Not supported (by design)

- `G17`/`G18`/`G19` (plane select) — we're always XY
- `G38.x` (probing)
- `G43` (tool length offset), `G53` (machine coord), `G54`-`G59` (WCS)
- `G80`-`G89` (canned cycles)
- `G92.1` (clear G92 offset)
- `$H` (homing — no switches on Blot)
- `$C` (check mode), `$SLP` (sleep)
- `$N0`/`$N1` (startup blocks)
- Tool change (`T`, `M6`)
- Coolant (`M7`, `M8`, `M9`)
- Variable spindle (`M3 S<rpm>` in RPM sense) — `S` is repurposed for servo µs
- Z axis (`Z`) — 2-axis machine, pen is servo-controlled
- Units-per-minute-inverse-time (`G93`)
- Arcs on planes other than XY

If you need any of these, stock GRBL-HAL on a different board covers them.
